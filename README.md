# ops-to-devops

My personal notes for Ops colleagues with tasks to do to dive into DevOps work.

* **practical cases to learn new tools by doing**;
* orienteers _where to go_, but you are free with _how to go_.

## Contribution

Please, feel free to

* copy/fork/share/star this repository content;
* create issues / pull requests if you have any corrections, suggestions, ideas or if you want to discuss something.

## Before you start

Ensure you

1. are self-education ready;
2. don't afraid to make something work even in a simple/dirty way before making it better;
3. know what's burnout at work (please, avoid this!), if you know Russian, see [this](https://youtu.be/TeSOcYzwx9A) and [this](https://youtu.be/fppiS0gUX7A) videos from our IT colleagues about this;
4. have Linux/Unix environment to work (any Linux, MacOS, Windows with WSL or Linux VM onboard), [here's my Linux WS setup example](https://github.com/and1er/linux-ws);
5. have an IDE (I recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with a lot of free plugins and Remote-SSH workspace feature);
6. saw the [DevOps Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops) to know approximate path.

## Sign up for GitHub.com

Checklist.

1. I have personal GitHub.com account.
2. I setup 2FA for my account.
3. I generated and added to the account my _SSH key_ for repository authentication (for pull & push).
4. (optional) I generated and added to the account my _GPG key_ for commit signing to have _Verified_ badge for my commits to guarantee I'm an author of my commits (Git allows to set arbitrary `user.name` and `user.email` properties).
5. I set [email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails) to keep my email private in commits
    * `Keep my email addresses private`
    * `Block command line pushes that expose my email`

## English checklist

English language is very important for work. But English study is also a long way, so try to use it daily to improve your skills little by little.

* **Reading**: I use documentation in English as primary information sources.
* **Writing**: I write in English any of own docs, code and commit comments.
* **Listening:** I watch videos and courses by English speakers (at least with subtitles), e.g. on YouTube, Udemy.
* (recommended) **Speaking:** I have a English tutor or group for speaking practice at least for 1-2 hour 1-2 times in a week.
